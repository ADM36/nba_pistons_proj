Visual and statistical comparisons of the Detroit Pistons vs league leaders from 2000 - 2010


## Are the Detroit Pistons the lost dynasty of the 2000s?

### In an era many consider to be the most unwatchable in modern league history, a team without a true superstar but featuring a core group of five players made the NBA’s final four in six straight seasons, only coming away with one title. Was their relative success fueled by fortunate circumstance, or did they leave a couple championships on the table?

If you love professional basketball in 2020 (yes, 2020 is almost over), then you are most likely a fan of its pace (# team possessions), star-power, and seeing the likes of Stephen Curry and James Harden jack up threes at the same rate Vin Diesel and the Rock put out Fast & Furious films. This means you may have hated professional basketball throughout most of the 2000s. Although Y2K did not destroy our global technology infrastructure, it may have produced some of the slowest (90.1 pace), lowest scoring (102.9 ORtg), and stagnant basketball the modern NBA has ever seen. In 2020, the average team pace was 100.3. That’s ten more possessions Harden had to pirouette around defenders than Shaq had to break backboards. 

While most basketball fans are critical of the sluggish pace of the 2000s, a small enclave of fans from the state of Michigan were forced to respect the era where fast breaks were far and few between and teams won games by scoring less points than the Tune Squad did to save the Looney Tunes gang. I'm still surprised cartoon characters with the playing abilities of Charles Barkley and Patrick Ewing could only put up 76 on a team that started a duck and two rabbits, but hey—who am I to question scrappy defense?

On the twentieth anniversary of the first move that launched the Blue Collar Champions—the year Detroit traded the one-time first-team and four-time second-team All-NBA star Grant Hill for an undrafted back-up center who started at Cuyahoga Community College before transferring to Virginia Union University (Ben Wallace)—we are taking a look back at an era when Pistons basketball was at its peak. From 2003 to 2008, the Detroit Pistons were a perennial participant in the Eastern Conference finals. Their six consecutive appearances are the same number of appearances the Chicago Bulls had in the 90s. The Piston’s conference final teams were anchored by a starting five that totaled 16 all-star appearances, and their sole championship was against a team featuring Shaquille O’Neal (15 all-star appearances) and Kobe Bryant (18 all-star appearances), as well as a cameo now and then from Karl Malone (14 all-star appearances) and Gary Payton (9 all-star appearances). While the 2000s actually featured two real dynasties in the Los Angeles Lakers (2000, 2001, 2002) and the San Antonio Spurs (2003, 2005, 2007), the Detroit Pistons were a few lost games away from creating a legacy similar to that of the Bad Boys Pistons, who won two championships at the end of the Larry vs. Magic era and before Michael Jordan and the Bulls dominated the 90s. 

But realistically, how many championships could a team who’d never had a superstar and was centered around a supposedly 6’9 center (Wallace says he is 6’7) who averaged more than 35 minutes, 41 percent at the free-throw line, and 5.9 points per game? Although he wasn’t on the last two Eastern Conference contenders, when Wallace was traded to the Pistons twenty years ago he became the centerpiece of a dynasty that never was. 

## METHODOLOGY 

In the age of advanced analytics, there are myriad ways to analyze why a champion became a champion. For each of the six years the Pistons made it to the conference finals, we are going to look at where they ranked in the league for offensive and defensive team stats over the regular season. This analysis will be known as the Completeness Confirmation going forward. There are 19 offensive and defensive categories which include a team's field-goal percentage, how many steals they averaged, how many fouls they gave, etc. Offensive categories reflect what that team produced in a game. Defensive categories show what opponents produced against a team in a game.

If a team ranks within the top 5 of all teams that year for a given category, they receive a point. If that team ranks in the bottom 5 of a category, they lose a point. I know and will accept the argument that not all of these stats are equal. Does being the league leader in steals mean as much as being the league leader in field-goal percentage? Probably not, but we aren't concerned with that in this analysis. This analysis is simply a holistic method for quantifying the completeness of a team.

***NBA Finals Champion**

WHAT HAPPENED? You could argue this should have been Sacramento’s title, but the Spurs and the Nets positioned themselves in the title series, and  New Jersey was actually 12-2 in the playoffs before reaching the Finals that season, perhaps confirming the completeness, but not the championship. If we look down this list, we come to the team everyone in Michigan was being force-fed through Fox Sports Detroit. The Pistons went 50-32 that year with head coach Rick Carlisle at the helm. This was before he decided to shave his head but after he instituted tough defense as the mantra. The Piston’s pace was 86.8 that season; good for dead last in the league. As painful as it might have been to watch, that style of play got them to their first Eastern Conference Finals in 12 years. They got swept by Jason Kidd’s Nets, but the league began to notice that Detroit was a defensive force.

WHAT HAPPENED? Los Angeles should NOT have made it to the finals. San Antonio had the better all-around team, but Kobe plus Shaq and some Derek Fisher magic spoiled a return trip for the Spurs. Detroit winning that matchup was the correct outcome according to the completeness confirmation. Tayshaun Prince hounded Kobe Bryant, and the injury-riddled Lakers fumbled often and didn't move enough of their offense through a dominant Shaq. 

That Piston’s offense was ranked 24 out of 29 teams that season, but they shut down their opponents on defense. They were the best blocking team in the NBA (6.9), the best three-point defending team in the NBA (29%) and allowed the fewest points per game (84.3), tied with San Antonio. One of the keys to the Laker’s offense that season was averaging the highest number of free throws in the league (28.7), but the Pistons played sound man on man defense, averaging in the bottom five in the league for fouls given (20.3). 

 
This bar chart displays an inter quartile range (IQR) to show how well teams compare against the league average for points allowed. The red line is the average number of points allowed (93.40). Teams whose bar extends into the red are in the worst 16% of league teams in points allowed, whereas teams whose bar is found in the green highlighted area are in the best 16% of league teams. 

An orange bar denotes that a team is in the ’49 & Up Club,’ having won 49 or more games that season.

WHAT HAPPENED? Robert Horry hit a 3 in Game 5. Nothing more to say. 

I think these Pistons were even better than the championship team, but this Spurs team was also really good. The Spurs had the best plus/minus in the league (7.8), opponents averaged under 17 assists a game (16.9) and they held opponents to under four three pointers a game (3.9). Yes, FOUR threes a game. James Harden made 4.8 threes a game in 2018-19. That series could have easily gone either way—and like I said, we are not discussing Big Shot Rob.

It should also be mentioned that while the Phoenix Sun’s defense was average to below-average, their offense was face-melting (for 2005). They averaged 110.4 points per game, the best mark in the league. The second-ranked team in points scored, Sacramento, only averaged 103.7 points per game. That’s almost a seven-point game between the top two teams! Phoenix was also the best rebounding team in the league (44.1). Steve Nash, Amare, the Matrix and Joe Johnson were fun to watch, but in this case,  we know what happened when an unstoppable three-point shooting force met an immovable three-point stopping defense. The Suns would also point to Johnson being held out of games one and two of the Western Conference Finals (both Suns losses) thanks to former Piston Jerry Stackhouse. 

 
Teams made, on average, only 3.9 three-point shots a game against San Antonio in the 2004-05 season.

WHAT HAPPENED? Star power became an issue the Pistons could not fully overcome. A 21 years-old Lebron James and ... um … 30 years-old Zydrunas Ilgauskas took the Pistons to 7 in the semi-finals. In the conference finals, Miami convincingly handled Detroit in enough games as Dwayne Wade did what Kobe couldn't in 2004 and torched the Pistons defense, while giving Shaq better offensive opportunities. The best part of this series: Ben Wallace's MONSTAR block of Shaq in game 5 of the conference. However, the Pistons could have won it all this year.

The fact that the Pistons didn’t at least make it to the Finals that year is criminal. In 2005, they ranked seventeenth in the league in offensive rating. In 2006, they ranked fourth, and they still ranked in the top five in defensive rating. They became a top-five three-point shooting team (39%) while having the best three-point defense in the league (31%). They turned the ball over the least amount of any team in the league (11.4), and gave up the fewest amount of foul-shots (20.5). They went 64-18 in the regular season, and had a solid eight man rotation with Antonio McDyees, Maurice Evans and late acquisition Tony Delk. It still doesn’t sit right with me, but Shaq got his revenge from 2004. 

 
On average, Detroit only gave up 20.5 foul shots a game during the 2005-06 season. Sacramento had the second-best rating, giving up more than 23 foul shots a game.

WHAT HAPPENED? Detroit lead the Eastern Conference Finals 2-0 before Daniel "Boobie" Gibson played Robin to Lebron James's Batman and won the next four games to welcome James to his first NBA Finals appearance. The Pistons also had a worse overall rating that year, especially on defense, which could be attributed to this being the first year the team was without 4-time Defensive Player of the Year, Ben Wallace. San Antonio went on to sweep the Cavs, so I don't think the Pistons would have fared much better considering the completeness numbers from the Spurs that year. 

This wasn’t the first year the Western Conference seemed a lot better than the Eastern Conference, but it felt like it in many ways. The Mavericks, Suns, and eventual NBA Champion Spurs just looked a lot better than any team in the Eastern Conference. The only Eastern Conference team in the top five plus/minus ranking was the Chicago Bulls (5.01), and they didn’t even make it to the conference finals. The Pistons still had the sixth overall rated offensive and seventh overall rated defense, but they just didn’t look as good. They ranked in the top five of the league for points allowed (91.8), had the fewest number of turnovers (12.2) and had the highest number of blocks (5.8), but the roster that year was different. Without Ben Wallace the team picked up Chris Webber and Nazr Mohammad, while also adding Ronald “Flip” Murray. Webber was slow (could still shoot), Mohammad was slow (but tall), and Flip Murray was Flip Murray. The Pistons had a solid six-man rotation in the playoffs, but after that, it wasn’t great. Antonio McDyees and Murray shot under 36 percent in the playoffs, and this team wasn’t defensively prepared to stop young Lebron.

The top of the Western Conference overmatched every team in the East in the 2006-07 season, and Dallas and San Antonio’s defenses were the most complete in the league. 


### 2007 – 08
Team	Offensive Points	Defensive Points	Total Points
Detroit Pistons	3	14	17
**Boston Celtics	0	10	10
*Los Angeles Lakers	12	-2	10
San Antonio Spurs	-2	10	8
Phoenix Suns	9	-2	7
Denver Nuggets	10	-8	2

WHAT HAPPENED?: After Boston struggled through a 7 game slog against Boobie and Delonte West (I seriously cannot believe the level of talent James had to play with), the men in green had a competitive six game series with the Pistons. In the second season without Ben Wallace (overpaid by Chicago) the Pistons defense was again one of the best in the league, and had better offensive production with Antonio McDyess in the starting lineup. However, star power again seemed to be the Achilles heel of the Pistons, with KG, Paul Pierce, Ray Allen and Rajon Rondo being too much for Detroit to handle. Boston also sported the league’s best defense. And while this may be the biggest stretch of them all … the Pistons could have won it all this year and here’s why: 

The Pistons seemed more energized this year, possibly understanding the team was going to be blown up without another championship. They had the sixth best offensive rating and the fourth best defensive rating in the NBA, and two young bench guys in Jason Maxiell and Rodney Stuckey who could give them just enough when the starters needed a breather. They also had two solid older reserves in Lindsey Hunter and Theo Ratliff who shot it well in the playoffs. This team gave up the fewest amount of points in the league (90.1), ranked in the top five for three-point defense, and in the top five for fewest number of rebounds, assists, blocks, and steals allowed. That team also hadn’t the second-best plus/minus in the league (7.4) behind the eventual NBA Champion Celtics (10.3). Yes, that is an impressive margin for the Leprechauns.

Somewhat flipping the script on the Western Conference’s top-heavy defensive dominance the previous season, Boston and Detroit dominated most defensive categories this season. Of course, San Antonio still had a top five defense. 

### 2008 – 09 
Team	Offensive Points	Defensive Points	Total Points
Detroit Pistons	-6	4	-2

Cue the funeral procession. The beginning of the end for the Pistons came on November 3, 2008, when Detroit traded Chauncey Billups and Antonio McDyees to the Denver Nuggets for an aging Allen Iverson. Detroit received a -2 rating  that year (-6 offense and 4 defense), and end up being swept by the Cavs in the first-round of the Eastern Conference playoffs. 

## The Fallout

Since those six straight Eastern Conference finals appearances, the Pistons have made three playoff appearances in the last 12 years, having been swept in all three of those appearances. In those 12 years, they gave big paydays to second and third-tier players who had solid seasons ahead of acquisition (Ben Gordon, Charlie Villanueva, Reggie Jackson), and have traded for all-stars who are past their prime in hopes to sell tickets and avoid full-on tanking (Blake Griffin). 

So what is the history of those Blue Collar Champions, especially outside of the team’s home-state? Undoubtedly for casual fans, they are a blip on the radar. If they are remembered, it’s probably because people couldn’t stand watching them. They were the team that spoiled the Laker’s 2003-2004 world tour. They are, in many ways, the antheses of Curry’s Warriors and Harden’s Rockets. The Warriors of today are full of star-power and shoot the ball at an incredible rate. The Rockets entire offense, for the most part, revolves around one generational All NBA talent. The 2000’s Pistons played in the half-court, slowed the game down and had one of the most balanced offensive teams of their decade. If that team played today, Rasheed Wallace would represent the stretch four/five every team dreams of snagging. Chauncey Billups and Richard Hamilton would shoot more threes and could be one of the best backcourts in the league, perhaps right behind Curry and Thompson. Tayshaun Prince would be a reliable three and D player, and Ben Wallace …. well, he would probably be an energetic, off-the-bench guy in a JaVale McGee type of role. 

As far as history is concerned, that team (according to completeness and some guy feelings) should have had over/under three championships, but they only came away with one. The three titles I am most confident in stating they should have won were 2003-04, 2004-05, and 2006-07. That would have made them a no-questions-asked dynasty. Although the Completeness Confirmation would say 2007-08 should have been the surest championship of them all for the Pistons, that year’s Celtics team was better than 2006 Heat and Mavericks, and on par with the 2005 Spurs. Contrary to the proclamations of the oracle Rasheed Wallace, sometimes the ball does lie, and sometimes we’re left wondering what the truth could have looked like.
